# automatic Irrigation System ðŸŒ±ðŸ’§

An automated irrigation system that waters plants based on soil moisture levels.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno / ESP8266
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Relay Module
- Water Pump
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Working
- The soil moisture sensor detects the dryness of the soil.
- If soil is dry, the microcontroller activates the relay and starts the water pump.
- Watering stops automatically when the required moisture level is reached.
